    <h2>What I hope to get out of this class</h2>
    <p>I am looking to get the knowledge and understanding to compete in the coding job market. Not only do I need to
        understand, but also need to be adaptable as this is an ever changing market. My biggest motivators are my two
        children. I want to put myself into a career so that I can support my family and provide them opportunities
        that I
        was provided with, and I believe that this course can help me achieve those goals. </p>
